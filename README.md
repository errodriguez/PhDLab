# PhDLab
A set of BASH scripts and other scriptlets to easily interact with Twitter's API from the command line.

## Backgound

This set of scripts were developed between 2016 thru 2018 as part of my PhD research at the IPN Centre for Computing Research (Centro de Investigación en Computación del Instituto Politécnico Nacional) at Mexico City, Mexico. There were not intended to be released to the public since they were developed with a very much specific idea and purpose in mind.

However, all of these scripts have been quite useful on various occasions and I have been using them multiple times for various reasons and for various purposes. So finally I decided to dust them off, restore them, and update them for these modern times.
