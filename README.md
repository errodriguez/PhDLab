# PhDLab
A set of BASH scripts and other scriptlets to easily interact with Twitter's API from the command line.

## Backgound

This set of scripts were developed between 2016 thru 2018 as part of my PhD research at the IPN Centre for Computing Research (Centro de Investigación en Computación del Instituto Politécnico Nacional) at Mexico City, Mexico. There were not intended to be released to the public since they were developed with a very much specific idea and purpose in mind.

Sin embargo, todos estos scripts han sido bastante útiles durante varias ocasiones y los he estado usando varias veces por varias razones y para varios propósitos. Entonces, finalmente, decidí desempolvarlos y restaurarlos para adaptarlos a estos tiempos modernos.

## REQUIREMENTS

These scripts were developed for BASH v4.0+. Some additional utilities may be required, depending from your unix distribution:

- OS X and macOS systems require a `sysvbanner` port.

  `$ brew install kuperman/sysvbanner/sysvbanner`

- `jq` utility is also required.
